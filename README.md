# dissimilarity-index
Scraped data on black-white dissimilarity for places in the United States. The data are from CensusScope, which is created by the Social Science Data Analysis Network, and based on 2000 Census numbers.

The data are in `res/`, sorted by state. Asterisks on the city names means that there are fewer than 1000 people of a race, so the dissimilarity index might be meaningless.
